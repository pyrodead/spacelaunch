The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/spacestation_images/international2520space2520station_image_20190220215716.jpeg"}]},{"id":126,"url":"http://spacelaunchnow.me/api/ll/2.2.0/event/126/?format=json","name":"Tianwen-1 Rover Landing","type":{"id":9,"name":"Landing"},"description":"The Tianwen-1 rover will attempt to land on Mars using a parachute to slow down and a propulsive landing for the final 1.5km of the descent.","location":"Utopia Planitia, Mars","news_url":null,"video_url":null,"feature_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/event_images/tianwen-1_rover_image_20200721110816.jpg","date":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","launches":[{"id":"485b9786-5bec-4dd4-ac82-69d1fd702047","url":"http://spacelaunchnow.me/api/ll/2.2.0/launch/485b9786-5bec-4dd4-ac82-69d1fd702047/?format=json","launch_library_id":1135,"slug":"https://spacelaunchnow.me/launch/long-march-5-tianwen-1-mars-global-remote-sensing","name":"Long March 5  | Tianwen-1 (Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover)","status":{"id":3,"name":"Success"},"net":"2020-07-23T04:41:15Z","window_end":"2020-07-23T07:00:00Z","window_start":"2020-07-23T04:00:00Z","mission":"Tianwen-1 (Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover)","mission_type":"Robotic Exploration","pad":"Wenchang | Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, People\'s Republic of China","location":"Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, People\'s Republic of China","landing":null,"landing_success":null,"launcher":null,"orbit":"Helio-N/A","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/long2520march25205_image_20191228095452.jpg"}],"expeditions":[],"spacestations":[]},{"id":36,"url":"http://spacelaunchnow.me/api/ll/2.2.0/event/36/?format=json","name":"OSIRIS-Rex Sample Return","type":{"id":9,"name":"Landing"},"description":"In September 2023 the OSIRIS-REx return capsule will re-enter Earth\'s atmosphere and land under a parachute at the Air Force\'s Utah Test and Training Range","location":"Earth","news_url":null,"video_url":null,"feature_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/event_images/osiris-rex2520sample2520return_image_20190729040745.jpg","date":"2023-09-01T04:00:00Z","launches":[{"id":"0bcc6850-4c51-4b08-aa19-0b3753351b9b","url":"http://spacelaunchnow.me/api/ll/2.2.0/launch/0bcc6850-4c51-4b08-aa19-0b3753351b9b/?format=json","launch_library_id":673,"slug":"https://spacelaunchnow.me/launch/atlas-v-411-osiris-rex","name":"Atlas V 411 | OSIRIS-REx","status":{"id":3,"name":"Success"},"net":"2016-09-08T23:05:00Z","window_end":"2016-09-09T01:05:00Z","window_start":"2016-09-08T23:05:00Z","mission":"OSIRIS-REx","mission_type":"Robotic Exploration","pad":"Space Launch Complex 41 | Cape Canaveral, FL, USA","location":"Cape Canaveral, FL, USA","landing":null,"landing_success":null,"launcher":null,"orbit":"Helio-N/A","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/atlas2520v2520411_image_20190224012306.jpeg"}],"expeditions":[],"spacestations":[]}]}')},176:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"count":179,"next":null,"previous":"http://spacelaunchnow.me/api/3.3.0/launch/upcoming/?format=json&limit=10&mode=detailed&offset=160","results":[{"id":"22e117bf-041c-49d5-9d09-7b180036e143","url":"http://spacelaunchnow.me/api/ll/2.2.0/launch/22e117bf-041c-49d5-9d09-7b180036e143/?format=json","launch_library_id":1365,"slug":"https://spacelaunchnow.me/launch/ariane-62-metop-sg-b1","name":"Ariane 62 | METOP-SG B1","img_url":null,"status":{"id":2,"name":"TBD"},"net":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","window_end":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","window_start":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","inhold":false,"tbdtime":false,"tbddate":false,"probability":-1,"holdreason":"","failreason":"","hashtag":null,"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":121,"launch_library_id":164,"url":"http://spacelaunchnow.me/api/ll/2.2.0/config/launcher/121/?format=json","name":"Ariane 62","description":"The Ariane 6 family is currently under development by the European Space Agency, with two variations including the Ariane 62 with two solid boosters intended for government and scientific missions.","family":"Ariane","full_name":"Ariane 62","launch_service_provider":{"id":115,"url":"http://spacelaunchnow.me/api/ll/2.2.0/agencies/115/?format=json","name":"Arianespace","featured":true,"type":"Commercial","country_code":"FRA","abbrev":"ASA","description":"Arianespace SA is a multinational company founded in 1980 as the world\'s first commercial launch service provider.
